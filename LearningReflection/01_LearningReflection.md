# Learning Reflection

> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- Smooth overall: navigation was clear, flows were easy to exercise, and the copy issues (e.g., “black” vs “blank” project) surfaced quickly.

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- Started with exploratory notes, then converted them into structured cases covering happy paths, copy/UX checks, and edge states; tracked them in a simple checklist to iterate fast.

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for test case management?
- A lightweight Kanban board with tags for priority/area works well; for heavier traceability, TestRail or Zephyr to version cases and map to requirements.

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
- Visual Studio Code with Markdown preview for quick proofing.

## 5. Did you find any trouble? How did you solve the trouble?
- Minor issue locating the source of certain copy strings; resolved by comparing UI screenshots with the available text assets.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using GitHub? Have you used GitHub before? Where?
- No trouble; have used GitHub for personal projects and team repos with a pull request workflow.

## 7. If in the future you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? Describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other).
- Cypress with TypeScript for fast feedback, strong DX, and built-in retryability; would supplement with Playwright if broader cross-browser coverage is required.

## 8. Search the term `Tester` or `Automation Tester` on Glassdoor/LinkedIn (or similar). List the skills and competencies most in-demand in software testing.
- In demand: JavaScript/TypeScript or Python for automation, API testing (Postman/RestAssured), CI/CD familiarity, cloud basics, SQL, Git, modern UI tools (Playwright/Cypress/Selenium), and clear communication for defect reporting.

## 9. If you continue a career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill the gaps in your resume?
- Technical: deeper API automation and contract testing, containerized test environments, and observability basics; Soft: concise stakeholder updates, risk-based planning under tight timelines, and clearer test reporting.

## 10. Short learning reflection and free words—did the project help put theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe any additional thoughts (quality of content, learning, improvement ideas).
- Yes—reviewing the UI and writing concise defect notes connected theory to practice, highlighting how small copy mistakes affect user trust. Improvement idea: include a style-guide checklist and a quick copy consistency pass in the standard test plan.
